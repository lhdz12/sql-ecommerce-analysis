# Brazilian E-Commerce Revenue Analysis (SQL Portfolio)

## Project Overview
This project is a SQL-based analytics portfolio built using a Brazilian e-commerce dataset (Olist-style).  
The goal is to demonstrate how SQL is used to answer real business questions related to revenue, customers, products, sellers, and time-based performance.

All analysis is written in plain `.sql` files and designed to reflect how a data analyst would work in a real business environment.  
A Python notebook is included to reproduce key queries and visualize results using charts.

## Dataset
The dataset represents an online marketplace with information about:  
- Customers  
- Orders  
- Order items  
- Products  
- Sellers  
- Product category translations (Portuguese → English)  

---

## Revenue Definition
Throughout the entire project, **revenue is consistently defined as:** `total_revenue`.  

Freight costs are intentionally excluded to focus on pure product revenue.

## Business Questions Answered

Each business question is answered in its own SQL file.

| SQL File | Business Question |
|--------|------------------|
| `revenue_per_customer.sql` | Who are the top customers by total revenue? |
| `revenue_per_category.sql` | Which product categories generate the most revenue? |
| `revenue_per_product.sql` | Which products generate the highest revenue? |
| `revenue_per_seller.sql` | Which sellers generate the most revenue? |
| `revenue_per_state.sql` | Which customer states generate the most revenue? |
| `revenue_per_year_month.sql` | How does revenue evolve over time (year–month)? |
| `top_seller_per_category_and_mkt_share.sql` | Which seller generates the most revenue in each category, and what percentage of revenue do they make? |

## Methodology & Design Decisions
- One business question per SQL file  
- Queries are written to be clear, readable, and well-commented  
- Explicit join paths are used to avoid ambiguity  
- Grouping and aggregations are carefully validated  
- Queries are designed for analytical clarity rather than optimization  

---

## Tools Used
- **SQLite** (query execution and testing)  
- **DB Browser for SQLite** (local testing only)  
- **Python** (optional notebook and visualizations using Matplotlib / Seaborn)  
- **Git & GitHub** (version control)  
- **SQL** (analysis and aggregation)  

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- SQL joins across multiple tables  
- Aggregations and grouping  
- Time-based analysis using `strftime`  
- Business-oriented analytical thinking  
- Clean and reproducible query design  
- Basic Python data visualization and commentary (optional)

## Summary Insights

- **Market Concentration by Category:** Revenue is concentrated mainly in categories such as **health_beauty** and **watches_gifts**. These top categories drive the majority of the business’s overall profitability.  
- **Customer Purchasing Behavior:** Each customer made only one purchase during the available time period; however, several high-value customers generated significant revenue individually.  
- **Seller Dominance:** Most sellers dominate their respective categories, often capturing **over 50% of category revenue**. This suggests a **specialization strategy**, where sellers focus on niches to maximize revenue.  
- **Revenue Over Time:** Revenue trends follow a typical **product life cycle**, peaking during late 2017 and early 2018, then experiencing a sharp decline in September 2018.  

### Key Takeaways
- Focus on **high-performing categories** to sustain and grow revenue.  
- Encourage sellers to **specialize strategically** in categories where they have expertise and can dominate.  
- Monitor revenue trends over time to identify **seasonal effects or product lifecycle impacts**.
